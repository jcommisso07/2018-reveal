        <h1>Hook and Winch</h1>
        <p1>The hook and winch system allows for flexibility when climbing. To climb, we simply deploy the hook by lifting the elevator and intake system, and rapidly move out of the way to allow another robot to deploy. The powerful winch is able to lift our robot in seconds.</p1>

        <h1>LEDs</h1>
        <p1>The LEDs on the robot leds aren‚Äôt just for look; they serve a purpose. Led strips are used to indicate activity on the robot. For example, while the elevator is rising, the vertical leds will pulsate upwards. While deploying a crate, the horizontal leds will pulsate outwards.</p1>

    <section>
        <h1>Intake</h1>
        <p1>The intake system consists of two compliant wheels mounted to spring loaded arms. This allows crates to be picked up from all orientations. The intake system is able to shoot crates at angles and completely fold in.</p1>

        <h1>Drive Train</h1>
        <p1>Our drive train is unique to this year's game. By using mechanism wheels with a drop drive, we are able to ‚Äúrun circles‚Äù around other robots, while maintaining control when necessary.</p1>
